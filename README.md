## I. PROJECT GOALS

*"The goal of this project is to apply Reinforcement Learning and suitable machine learning algorithms learned in class or self-learned to solve a specific problem. Represent the results in graphical/table formats and make analysis and conclusions."*

## II. DATA INFORMATIONS

### i. CHOSEN DATA REPOSITORY

Data repositories used:

1) Kaggle Data Repository : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets
2) TensorFlow Datasets: https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets


### ii. CHOSEN DATASETS

Datasets used:

1) Amazon Fine Food Reviews: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews
   *"This dataset consists of reviews of fine foods from amazon. The data span a period of more than 10 years, including all ~500,000 reviews up to October 2012. Reviews include product and user information, ratings, and a plain text review. It also includes reviews from all other Amazon categories."*
2) Gigaword: https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/gigaword
   *"Headline-generation on a corpus of article pairs from Gigaword consisting of around 4 million articles."*

## III. PROJECT SUMMARY

With this dataset we aim to solve a common problem in NLP (Natural Language Processing), which is automatic text summarization, using machine learning alghoritms (in this case, an abstractive approach) and Reinforcement Learning.
